            In my ceramic practice, I explore the delicate balance between structure and fluidity, precision and organic movement. My porcelain vessels emerge from an endless fascination with natural forms.

            Each piece begins as a meditation on transformation. Working with porcelain allows me to push the material to its limits, creating thin, petal-like structures that appear both fragile and resilient. I am drawn to the contradictions within this medium: how something so seemingly delicate can emerge stronger through fire, how something static can evoke dynamic movement.

            The repetitive, overlapping layers in my work reflect patterns found throughout nature, from unfurling blossoms to oceanic currents. By manipulating clay into these undulating forms, I invite viewers to experience the tension between chaos and order that exists in natural systems. The hollow centers create a dialogue between interior and exterior space, between what is revealed and what remains hidden.

            Through this body of work, I seek to evoke a sense of wonder and contemplation. These vessels occupy an intentional space between functional object and sculptural form, challenging our expectations of ceramic traditions while celebrating the boundless creativity of the natural world. The pristine whiteness of the unglazed porcelain emphasizes form over surface decoration, allowing light and shadow to activate the piece through subtle gradations.

            My process is as much about listening to the clay as it is about directing it. Each piece requires patience and precision, a careful dance between technical control and surrendering to the unpredictable nature of the material. In this practice, I find profound metaphors for life itselfâ€”
